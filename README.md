# Another attract mode scrapper
I wanted to update the artwork in my attract mode install but 
i didnt found a reliable scrapper that got me the snaps and marquee
so I wrote one that uses http://screenscraper.fr api.


# Install Instructions
```bash
sudo easy_install virtualenv
```
or even better:
```bash
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```
One of these will probably install virtualenv on your system. Maybe itâ€™s even in your package manager. If you use Ubuntu, try:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

Once you have virtualenv installed, just fire up a shell and create your own environment:

```bash
$ mkdir at_scrapper
$ cd myproject
$ virtualenv venv
```

Now we just need to activate the new env.

```bash
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Once in the new environment we can install the scrapper

```bash
at_scrapper $ git clone repo app
at_scrapper $ cd app
at_scrapper $ pip install -e
```

And thats it!

Now you can start using the scrapper, remember that you need to activate your environment
or you need to call the scrapper bin that is installed in the venv/bin folder
